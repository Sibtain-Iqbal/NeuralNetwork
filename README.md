### Project Description

This repository contains a machine learning project that leverages **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build and train neural networks. The goal is to apply deep learning techniques for tasks such as image recognition, classification, and predictive modeling.

### Key Features:
- Developed using **Python**.
- Neural network models built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- Trained on datasets like MNIST for image recognition.
- Optimized using advanced techniques such as learning rate schedules and model regularization.
