# NeuralNetwork
 This repository contains the implementation of various neural network models designed to predict student placement outcomes based on features such as CGPA, placement exam marks, and other relevant attributes. The project uses Python and popular deep learning libraries like Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate the neural networks. Visualizations for data exploration and decision boundaries are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  Key Features:  Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset using Pandas. Data Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for visual exploration of features and model performance. Neural Network Models: Implemented feedforward neural networks with customizable layers and activation functions. Model Training and Evaluation: Trained models using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated their performance on training and test datasets. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model architecture and learning parameters. Decision Boundary Plotting: Visualized decision regions using mlxtend. Technologies Used:  TensorFlow/Keras for model building. Scikit-learn for data splitting and metrics evaluation. Seaborn/Matplotlib for data and results visualization. Pandas for data manipulation. This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of building, training, and evaluating neural networks for predictive tasks.
